Visualized Deep Learning Models. Learn the most classic models in an intuitive way that has never been seen before, and quickly master cutting-edge technology. Through modular diagrams, understand how data changes from input to output and how it changes at each step. There are detailed documents for each module, and even reference papers, source codes and animations.

Visual neural network model editor. Quickly build a model by dragging your fingers. What you see is what you get: Through real-time calculation and display of the output of each step, the construction of the model has never been so intuitive and efficient; real-time display of various errors, including parameters/input types and value compatibility, etc., abandoning inefficient debugging.
